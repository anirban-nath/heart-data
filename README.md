# Heart Data Analysis using Neural Network

A 3-layer neural network implemented using Keras (using Tensorflow backend) to predict a person's likeliness to have a hert disease based on 13 cinical factors. Project was done as an exercise to understand and implement various initializers and normalization techniques.
